## Known Issues

### Current Limitations

#### Performance
- **Large character sets** can be memory intensive
- **Very long passwords** (>10 chars) may take impractical time
- **Single-threaded bottlenecks** in some code paths

#### Compatibility
- **PDF versions** - Some newer PDF encryption methods not supported
- **Platform differences** - Minor performance variations across OS
- **Memory constraints** - Large search spaces require significant RAM

#### Features
- **Dictionary attacks** not yet implemented
- **Resume functionality** not available
- **GPU acceleration** not implemented

### Workarounds

#### Large Search Spaces
```bash
# Use progressive strategy
pdf-pycrack file.pdf --min-len 1 --max-len 4  # Start small
pdf-pycrack file.pdf --min-len 5 --max-len 6  # Then expand
```

#### Memory Issues
```bash
# Reduce batch size and processes
pdf-pycrack file.pdf --cores 2 --batch-size 50
```

#### Slow Progress
```bash
# Use specific character sets
pdf-pycrack file.pdf --charset-numbers  # Fastest
pdf-pycrack file.pdf --charset-letters  # Medium
```
